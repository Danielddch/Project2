# Project2

Hi! My name is Daniel Huynh and this is a mini project done for my Interaction and Design class!

In this project, the main goal was to create a visual interaction using p5 library while also acessing data from a json file or api equivalent.
Here, I used a live api to get the conversion rates of international currencys compared to the US dollar and used the rates to scale the equivalent currency to size. 
Since this is a api the size will be updated in real time and change their sizes if the rates change.
I then took the code and made all the currency use a png of their respective currency and had them bounce around the screne and a small Earth at the center.

In the end the project was accomplished with minimal bugs:
1.Images wern't showing up properly
2.Sometimes the images phase through Earth or jitter in place before fixing itself.

Otherwise, this was a very fun project to do! Espically with it being my first time touching p5.

Thanks for looking!
